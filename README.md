Name: To-Do List program in Ruby
Date: 3/3/23
Creator: Lorenzo Juarez

Description:
This is a simple program written in Ruby that creates a to-do list. It defines a TodoList class that has methods to add, delete, show, complete, and incomplete tasks in the list.

Challenges Faced:
The main challenge faced while writing this program was to implement the methods that add, delete, and modify tasks in the to-do list while keeping track of their completion status.

Future Improvements:
In the future, the program could be improved by adding the ability to sort tasks by their completion status or due date, and adding a feature to save the to-do list to a file.

How to Use:
To use the program, create an instance of the TodoList class and call its methods to add, delete, show, complete, and incomplete tasks in the list.
